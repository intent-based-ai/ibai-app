# Welcome to Intent Based AI Agent Development

Forget about MCP servers, the tools are where the true power lies!

MCP's server‑first approach forces you to declare how to integrate AI and tools up front. Our new intent‑based MCP flips that: you simply declare what you need, and the engine figures out how to wire up the right tools. This shift slashes integration time, cuts maintenance overhead, and unlocks agile innovation—empowering engineers, delighting product leaders, and delivering measurable cost and time savings.

This project aims to provide tools and resources for developers to create advanced AI applications using Intent Based AI principles.
